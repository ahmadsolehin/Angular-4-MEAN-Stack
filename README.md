# MEAN4+ Starter
Setting up a MEAN4+ App (MongoDB, Express.js, Nodejs, Angular)

<p>To develop more robust Angular apps, sometimes it's necessary to integrate Angular (the frontend) with an actual backend.</p>

One such popular stack for achieving this is the MEAN stack. It's an acronym for:

<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Express.js</li>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Nodejs</li>

Good luck!
