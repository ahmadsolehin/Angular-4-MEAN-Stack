# MEAN4+ Starter
Setting up a MEAN4+ App (MongoDB, Express.js, Nodejs, Angular)

<p>To develop more robust Angular apps, sometimes it's necessary to integrate Angular (the frontend) with an actual backend.</p>

One such popular stack for achieving this is the MEAN stack. It's an acronym for:

<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Express.js</li>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Nodejs</li>


<p>The Angular team pushes out a lot of updates. Within 2017, Angular will have gone from version 2, to 4, and ultimately to 5 in September. Because of this, it has been difficult for developers to find reliable MEAN configurations that will work with the latest version of Angular.</p>

Fortunately, here's a brand spanking new tutorial that will provide you with a working MEAN4 (and soon, MEAN5) stack. So, let's get started!

Good luck!
